The question my group chose was how do evolving technologies alongside cybersecurity threats impact the balance between data privacy and user convenience?

We chose this topic because it is a common question and has many answers that all aid to impact the overall balance between user conviencience and data privacy.

To give a definition for each, security can be defined as 6 things . . .

1. Confidentiality
2. Non-repudiation
3. Integrity
4. Accountability
5. Authenticity
6. Availbility

With a definition for security usability or user convencience can include

1. Learnability
2. Appropriateness recognizability
3. Operability
4. User error protection
5. User interface asethetics
6. Universality

Often these problems are contradictory and will lead to developers and creators favoring one over the other for certain features. However, technologies are always developed with both in mind and must be, as otherwise it would lead to a defeciency in usability or security from the favoring of security over usability or vice versa.

Now I'll hand it off to Tristan for a more in depth breakdown.
