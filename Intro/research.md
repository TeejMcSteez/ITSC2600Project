### Security Requirements (6 Reqs)

1. Confidentiality
2. Non-repudiation
    - Parties are responsible for their actions
3. Integrity
4. Accountability
    - Monitoring and tracking users actions to make sure they made the actios.
5. Authenticity
6. Availbility
    - Makes system availible for all authed individuals or systems.

### Usability Requirements

1. Learnability
2. Appropriateness recognizability
3. operability
4. User error protection
5. User interface asethetics
6. Universality

### Synopsis

There is difficulty in designing a system in which is highly intuitive, secure, and accessable. The more technology grows the easier it becomes to integrate things that before were not digital into the digital space.

In doing so one must be certain that they are improving the usefulness of the product without introducing any problems or harmed caused by the improvement.

Things such as ones digital signature, tracking (Geolocation, etc), protocols like two factor authentications are all examples of improvements to this field/domain.

Companies have improved by working closer with system analysts and security professionals to build a system with these problems in mind, rather than an afterthought. As well as third party companies being entirely based on handling these problems for other companies.

Technology must be developed with user access and availibility in mind as well as security and authenticity. If companies or creators develop technology with this in mind then not only will software be better for the users, users will also be protected by the companies ensuring there tech is safe and authentic.
